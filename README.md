- 👋 Hi, I’m @tobiekwe
- 👀 I’m interested in python programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cloud architecting. I also have offline psv video which I need to access but due to expired subscription, I am finding it difficult to access.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic steps of software architecture and design and development. How to get relevant tools and supports.
- 📫 How to reach me is via tgord2002@yahoo.com.
